Hi, I'm Vladimir, a [42 Nice](https://42nice.fr) student and a young fellow developper !

I've been following 42's main cursus since March 2022 after the "piscine" of February 2022.

Here you will find all my coding journey through 42 (and more...) with all the differents projects I made, documented with my researchs and my approaches to find solutions to them.

C is the most powerfull coding language and I don't even want to argue on thatüòé</br>
C with classes is just easier C so be brave and embrace C!</br>

Check out all the crazy projects I've done and feel free to contact me for more details üöÄ

Of course I'm open to work and let's do it together if you want to achieve everything you ever wanted üí™ </br>

  the difficulties cannot be great."*</br>
