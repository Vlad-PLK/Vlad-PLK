Hello everyone, I'm Vladimir, a 42 Nice Student.

I'm currently 19 years old and I've been following 42's main course since March 2022. I've passed the "piscine" of February 2022 successfully and after
a month of rest I started the cursus. 
Right now, I'm coding and learning in C, but during 42's common core i will also learn C++ and Javascript. 

I'm hoping to become a full-stack developper in Web3 after graduating 42. For the moment (October 2022), I'm finishing the 3rd circle and I will be heading
to Minishell and Philosopher.

Here you will find all my journey throw 42 school, with all the differents projects documented with my researchs and my approaches to find solutions to them.

Now you can find here : 
  - LIBFT
  - PRINTF
  - GET NEXT LINE
  - PUSH SWAP
  - SO LONG
  - PIPEX

If you have any questions or subjects you wanna discuss with me, fell free to ask me here or on slack (vpolojie) if you are a 42 student.

See you soon and hope you enjoy my page !
