Hi, I'm Vladimir, a junior developper and a student of [42 Nice](https://42nice.fr) since March 2022.

Here you will find all my coding journey through 42 Cursus and more of my personnal projects I made, documented with all my researchs and my approaches to solve to them.

The fundamental pillar of a great developper besides in learning C and I don't even want to argue on thatüòé</br>
C with classes is just easier C so be brave and embrace C!</br>

Check out all my projects bellow and feel free to contact me for more details üöÄ

Of course I'm open to work and let's do it together if you want to achieve everything you ever wanted üí™ </br>

  the difficulties cannot be great."*</br>
