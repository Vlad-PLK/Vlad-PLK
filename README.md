Hello everyone, I'm Vladimir, a 42 Nice Student.

I've been following 42's main course since March 2022 after the "piscine" of February 2022. 
I'm hoping to become a full-stack developper in Web3 after graduating.

Here you will find all my journey throw 42, with all the differents projects (based on 42's holy graph) documented with my researchs and my approaches to find solutions to them.
